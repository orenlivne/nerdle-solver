Nerdle solver. A straightforward application of Knuth's algorithm as applied to Mastermind and implemented in
Python in https://betterprogramming.pub/solving-mastermind-641411708d01.

"Nerdle answers don't use leading zeros or lone zeros, even though some may be accepted as valid guesses.
So you won't find an answer like this: 0+5+5=10, or like this: 01+2+1=4. However, 0 is allowed as the
answer to the right of the equal sign (i.e. 5-3-2=0 is allowed)."
Thus:
1. = must be in th e5th, 6th, or 7th slots in the answer.
2. (= can be in 2nd..7th slot in a guess.).

"Nerdle answers don't start with negative numbers or have a negative number after the equals sign, even though
these may be accepted as valid guesses. So you won't find an answer like this: -5-6=-11. We get it."

3. Only digits may follow =.
4. An operation must be followed by a number.
5. The first slot must be a digit.
6. There has to be at least one op, since the number of slots (8) is even, so can't have xxx=xxx as in 7 slots, say.
